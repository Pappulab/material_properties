Simulation results and analysis codes for the computation of rheological properties in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-024-02558-1

The `source_data` folder contains all experimental and computational data for the final figures. The `raw_data` folder contains all raw rheological data from the simulations for all variants at all available temperatures, along with notes explaining the nomenclature and giving the volume fractions to use in subsequent analysis. For more information, including the data structure, please see the comments in the .m files in the `codes` folder.

The `trajectories` folder contains the three trajectory files for the WT^+NLS system at the simulation temperature, T = 53. For the A1-LCD, this temperature corresponds to 296.8 K.
