Simulation results and analysis codes for the computation of rheological properties in https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.06.535902

The `source_data` folder contains all experimental and computational data for the final figures. The `raw_data` folder contains all raw data from the simulations.

The `trajectories` folder contains three trajectory files for the WT^+NLS system at the simulation temperature, T = 53.
