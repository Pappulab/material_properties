Simulation results and analysis codes for the computation of rheological properties in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-024-02558-1

The `source_data` folder contains all experimental and computational data for the final figures.

The `trajectories` folder contains the three trajectory files for the WT^+NLS system at the simulation temperature, T = 53. For the A1-LCD, this temperature corresponds to 296.8 K. Please also see the .m files in the `codes` folder for new comments and minor updates.
